# PT430
PRACTEL PT-430 Color bar Generator EPROM Code generator.
The PRACTEL PT-430, developed in the early 1990s for the Australian broadcast industry, was primarily used in Electronic News Gathering (ENG) to transmit station IDs over microwave links.\
This repository aims to recreate the 27C64 EPROM code that generates the PT-430â€™s color bar and pulse-and-bar test patterns, including a center-aligned station ID. Through reverse engineering,\
I've determined that the EPROM utilizes two horizontal counters to sequentially output 4-bit GRBW data, controlling both the test pattern and embedded ID.

This project serves as a functional emulation of the PT-430, enabling continued use in amateur television (ATV) applications.
